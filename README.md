# Hi, I'm Joe Fletcher 👋

After spending the last 8 years working in leadership roles within E-Commerce I decided that I actually wanted to **make** things.  That was March 2020, fast forward to now and after intensive study and hands-on experience creating custom apps and websites, I am ready to utilise my unique skillset to help businesses achieve their goals. 

*A bit more about me...*

- I'm currently focussing on React and Javascript
- Looking to contribute to some interesting open source projects
- Live in South London
- Keen traveller (or at least I used to be 😷 ) - before Covid hit I had been travelling round South America for 8 months
- 🏊 🚴‍♂️ 🏃🏻‍♂️  Training for Ironman Copenhagen (Aug 2021 🤞)

If you want to know anything else, please get in touch!
